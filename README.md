# What is RFM analysis?

* RFM analysis is a customer behavior segmentation technique. Based on customers’ historical transactions, RFM analysis focuses on 3 main aspects of customers’ transactions: recency, frequency and purchase amount. Understanding these behaviors will allow businesses to cluster different customers into groups
